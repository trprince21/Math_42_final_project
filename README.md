# Modeling Wildfire Occurrence and Severity


## Brief Description:

For a group project in my Math 42 class, I aimed to predict the probability of wildfire occurrence via machine learning. Using the glmnet package in R, I trained the logistic regression model to predict the probability of wildfire occurrence by performing k-fold cross-validation. I also tested my predictive model via the caret package in R to assess its accuracy and limitations. I utilized comprehensive data on Montesinho Natural Park for training and testing a predictive model for wildfire occurrence.
